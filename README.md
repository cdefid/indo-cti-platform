## ⚠️ Why Threat Intelligence Sharing Matters

Cyber threats are increasing in complexity and frequency. Many organizations in Indonesia face attacks but struggle to share or access relevant threat data. This platform exists to:

- Break silos between security teams and communities
- Enable quick reporting and awareness of active threats
- Build a central knowledge base of IoCs, TTPs, breach alerts, and threat actors
- Empower both technical and non-technical contributors
